# Coin-Counter
This machine has the capability to sort and count coins by using a mechanism where the coins will be sorted by size and counted every time they fall into their corresponding box. 

- The code was done using the mikroC PRO for PIC IDE.
- The code is only done for one coin but it can be addapted for 4 coins as well by doing the same process.
